1. How long did you spend on the coding test? 
   I allocated 5 to 6 hours/days to complete the coding test. During this time, I faced several challenges that contributed to the overall duration:
   - Deciding on the color scheme and UI layout, which required brainstorming and design considerations.
   - Implementing animations in the checklist to enhance user experience and interactivity.
   - Troubleshooting and refining the filtering functionality for tasks by status, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
    The most useful feature added to the latest version of React is the introduction of React Hooks, which enable functional components to manage state and perform side effects. In the provided code snippet for the task management project, several React Hooks are utilized:
    useState Hook: 
    const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
    const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
    const [taskTitle, setTaskTitle] = useState('');
    const [taskDescription, setTaskDescription] = useState('');
    const [taskPriority, setTaskPriority] = useState('medium');
    const [taskDate, setTaskDate] = useState('');
    const [editTaskId, setEditTaskId] = useState(null);
    const [selectedPriority, setSelectedPriority] = useState('');
    const [selectedStatus, setSelectedStatus] = useState('all');
    const [isSidebarOpen, setIsSidebarOpen] = useState(true);
    Here, useState is used to create and manage various state variables within the functional component.

    useEffect Hook:useEffect(() => {
    const storedTasks = localStorage.getItem('tasks');
    if (storedTasks) {
    setTasks(JSON.parse(storedTasks));
    }
    }, []);
    The useEffect hook is employed to perform side effects such as fetching data from local storage when the component mounts.

These React Hooks significantly enhance the readability, scalability, and maintainability of the codebase by simplifying state management and side effect handling within functional components.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
    As a junior React developer, I haven't had direct experience tracking down performance issues in production yet. However, I understand that tracking down performance issues typically involves several steps:

    1. Identifying the Problem: The first step is to identify which part of the application is experiencing performance issues. This can involve looking at specific components, network requests, or overall page load times.

    2. Using Profiling Tools: React comes with built-in profiling tools like React Developer Tools and Chrome DevTools. These tools can help analyze component render times, identify re-renders, and pinpoint areas of improvement.

    3. Analyzing Network Requests: Performance issues can also be related to slow network requests or large asset sizes. Analyzing network requests using browser developer tools can provide insights into areas that need optimization.

    4. Code Review and Optimization: After identifying the problem areas, reviewing the codebase for inefficiencies, unnecessary re-renders, or large data operations can help improve performance. Techniques like memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting can be applied for optimization.

    5. Seeking Senior Help: As a junior developer, seeking help from senior developers or experienced peers is essential. They can provide guidance, review your approach, and suggest advanced optimization techniques.

In summary, tracking down performance issues involves a combination of profiling tools, code analysis, and collaboration with senior developers to implement effective optimizations.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
    If I had more time, I would focus on adding the following additional features to the task management application:

    1. Responsive Design: Implementing a responsive design would ensure that the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes. This includes optimizing layouts, font sizes, and interactive elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.

    2. Notification System: Adding a notification system would enhance user experience by providing timely updates and reminders for tasks. Notifications could include reminders for upcoming tasks, alerts for overdue tasks, and notifications for task assignments or comments.

These features would significantly improve the usability and effectiveness of the task management application, making it more versatile and user-friendly for a wider range of users.
