Task Pro App
Overview:
Task Pro is a simple task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. It provides features such as filtering tasks based on title, status, and priority, as well as hiding or expanding the sidebar for better navigation.

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, run npm start to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the Task Pro app.

Usage:
1. Tasks will be relatively short in description to fit within the UI.
2. The priority dropdown menu will be used to filter tasks based on urgency (Low, Medium, High).
3. Use the search bar to filter tasks based on title.
4. Use the dropdown menu to filter tasks based on status:
    All Tasks: Display all tasks regardless of status.
    Upcoming Tasks: Display tasks that are scheduled for the future.
    Overdue Tasks: Display tasks that have passed their due dates.
    Completed Tasks: Display tasks that have been marked as completed.
5. To hide or expand the sidebar, click the << or >> buttons respectively.
6. Click on the "Clear" button to clear all applied filters and reset the task list to its default state.

Assumptions:
1. The task descriptions will be relatively short to fit within the UI.
2. Users are familiar with basic task management functionalities such as creating, editing, and deleting tasks.
3. The application is designed for desktop and laptop use; mobile responsiveness is not a primary concern.
4. Task priorities are categorized as Low, Medium, and High for filtering purposes.

Additional Information:
1. The application is built using React and styled with CSS.
2. Local storage is utilized to persist tasks between sessions.
3. For any issues or feedback, please contact mullapudi.naveena1111@gmail.com.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
